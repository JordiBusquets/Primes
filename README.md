# Primes
Some prime number fun

In this file I just wrote a functon that generates all the prime number below a given threshold.

I then plot the propertion of primes within the first n integers, as a function of n, and I do this against 1/log(n), to show that they are asymptotically the same.

There are also a couple of other plots, histogram-like and so on.
